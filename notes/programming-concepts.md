# Programming Concepts

In this chapter we will learn about the different programming concepts which are the same in one way or another as in other programming languages. Specifically, weâ€™ll learn about **variables**, **basic types**, **functions**, **comments**, and **control flow**. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
